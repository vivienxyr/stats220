# Hello there!
Welcome to my Stats220 website!

For our first assignment in my [Statistics220](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/STATS/220/1223) course at the University of Auckland, we were instructed to create a meme on RStudio. 

*My inspiration for my meme incudes:*

<!--- unordered lists --->
* My unability to pick **one meme** format 
* My wish to include all **three** formats in the meme
* The challenge to find the original image of each meme 

Although there were certainly many learning curves in the process of creating this meme, I am proud to present the finished product.



**This is was made using the R package [{magick}](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html).**
