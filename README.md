# Stats220
## [Repository website](https://github.com/vivienxyr/stats220)

### Purpose:

The purose of this stats220 repository is to showcase the meme I made for my first assignment in my Statistics 220 course. This platform is easy to understand and has allowed me to view other repositories and gain inspiration for my future career goals as an aspiring data analyst. I utilised the skills I developed throughout the first 2 weeks of this course to create this.
